description: Explain code in a clear, educational way
---

Explain the code to the user in a clear, educational manner.

Your explanation should:

1. **Purpose**: Start with what the code does (the "why")
2. **Structure**: Explain the overall flow and key components
3. **Details**: Break down important logic, patterns, or techniques
4. **Context**: Note any dependencies, design patterns, or conventions used

Guidelines:

- Use simple language - assume the reader wants to understand, not just copy
- Highlight clever or non-obvious parts
- Point out potential gotchas or edge cases
- Reference specific line numbers when discussing particular sections
- Don't explain obvious code - focus on the meaningful parts

Format:

```
## Overview
[What the code does and why it exists]

## How it Works
[Step-by-step explanation of the logic]

## Key Points
[Important patterns, decisions, or techniques]

## Notes
[Any gotchas, performance considerations, or related context]
```

Keep explanations concise but thorough.
